This is a Django-based website whose purpose is to propose a global reformation of world religions by reaching out (or "appealing") to the broadest audience possible using tarot cards applied familiar topics.

"In a world where men do battle over whose version of God is most accurate, I cannot adequately express the deep respect and admiration I feel toward an organization in which men of differing faiths are able to break bread together in a bond of comradery, brotherhood, and friendship," courtesy of Dan Brown in a 2009 interview noted on page 48-49 in Mark E Koltko-Rivera's (2011) _Freemasonry: An Introduction_ (London England: Penguin Group)

Here are apps I've created and what their purpose is:

- generators: When a web user clicks the 'random' button, it serves one of twenty two tarot keys arbitrarily. Each tarot card webpage includes:
   -  A picture of the tarot key
   -  The name of the key
   -  Astrological Attribute
   -  Alchemical Attribute
   -  Intelligence
   -  Hebrew Letter
   -  Letter Meaning
   -  Description of the symbolic meaning
   -  The description applied to:
      - Galileo
      - FLOSS
      - St Paul the Apostle
  
  This app houses the most dynamic functionality of my whole website
- landings: Serves the landing/home page with the 'portal' template showing the extraordinary 'global initiation' message. This app also serves the 'about' template which is a webpage which explains the basic who, what, when, why (or purpose) of the website in general (similar to the preface to a book)
- essays: houses the paper.html template which captures a curated list of the most high impact tarot cards and their application to Galileo and FLOSS (bound together simultaneously) along with a curate list of tart cards applied to St. Paul. This essays app also serves up static articles (without dynamic functionality) similar to a blog post - - for essays by the author on tarot applied to Forrest Gump and Alex Jones. This essays app even includes an 'objections' page for content involving rebuttals from Slashdot. This essays app also includes a basic content_changelog.html template which enables the author to document changes made to essays or other content.
