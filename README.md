This is a Django-based website whose purpose is to propose a global reformation of world religions by reaching out (or "appealing") to the broadest audience possible using tarot cards applied familiar topics.

"In a world where men do battle over whose version of God is most accurate, I cannot adequately express the deep respect and admiration I feel toward an organization in which men of differing faiths are able to break bread together in a bond of comraderie, brotherhood, and friendship," courtesy of Dan Brown in a 2009 interview - - on page 48-49 in Mark E Koltko-Rivera's (2011) _Freemasonry: An Introduction_ (London England: Penguin Group)

Here are apps I've created and what their pupose is:

- generators: When a web user clicks the 'random' button, it serves one of twenty two tarot keys arbitrarily. This app houses the most dyanmic functionality of my whole website
- landings: Serves the landing/home page with the 'portal' template showing the extraorinadry 'global initiation' message. This app also serves the 'about' template which is a webpage which explains the basic who, what, when, why (or purpose) of the website in general (similar to the preface to a book)
- essays: houses the paper.html template which captures a curated list of the most high impact tarot cards and their application to Galileo and FLOSS (bound together simulataneously) along with a curate list of tart cards applied to St. Paul. This essays app also serves up static articles (without dynamic functionality) similar to a blog post - - for my essays on tarot applied to Forrest Gump and Alex Jones. This essays app even includes an 'objections' content for rebuttals on Slashdot as well as a basic content_changelog.html template which enables the author to document changes made to essays or other content.
